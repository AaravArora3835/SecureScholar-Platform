### Design Decisions
| Element | Choice | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Color Scheme** | Violet → Purple gradient (`#667eea` → `#764ba2`) | Represents creativity + technology |
| **Accent Color** | Gold (`#ffd700`) | Symbolizes achievement and gamification |
| **UI Style** | Glassmorphism | Modern, educational feel |
| **Font** | System UI | Lightweight and clean for readability |

---

### Key Learnings
- Practiced clean front-end structure using `/src` and `/Screenshots`.  
- Linked external CSS and JS paths correctly for the first time.  
- Learned how to publish websites instantly with **Netlify Drop**.  
- Understood how version control, evidence, and documentation fit together.

### Reflection
This marks the official start of the **SecureScholar journey**.  
I built my first complete site from scratch, deployed it publicly, and documented the process like a professional developer.  
The project is small but sets a foundation for consistency, design skills, and habit-building.

### Next Steps
- Plan **Module 1: Password Security** structure  
- Add a simple HTML/JS quiz prototype  
- Begin **Google Cybersecurity Certificate Week 1 (Oct 27)**  
- Link SecureScholar repo to **Cybersecurity-Portfolio-Hub**

**Status:** Week 0 Complete  
**Next Update:** Week 1 — Oct 27 2025
