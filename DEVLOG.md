### Reflection
This marks the official start of the **SecureScholar journey**.  
I built my first complete site from scratch, deployed it publicly, and documented the process like a professional developer.  
The project is small but sets a foundation for consistency, design skills, and habit-building.

- Add a simple HTML/JS quiz prototype  
- Begin **Google Cybersecurity Certificate Week 1 (Oct 27)**  
- Link SecureScholar repo to **Cybersecurity-Portfolio-Hub**
